# Movie-Recommender-System
In this project, I build a movie recommender system based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machines algorithm using PyTorch library in order to predict whether an individual will like a movie or not. Publicly available Movielens data set created by GroupLens Research has been used to train and validate the model.
